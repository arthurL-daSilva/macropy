# macropy
Macro, an automatic login for League of Legends or Valorant games through the RiotClient

# how it works?
It's in early development, but already works on Windowns 11 and
Only on Inglesh Riot Client.
First of all, you have to put the path of RiotClient on the code.
When it starts, it will try to call for RiotClient, if it isnt
already open. Then, will try to click on the Username box and do
all the process. Finaly, it will click on League Of Legends and
you will only click on Play and enjoy.

# Future plans
- ~implement an GUI~
- ~try to make a register system for a max of 4 accounts~
- ~Put the path of the Riot Client in the GUI~
- ~switch to VALORANT in the GUI~
- ~adapt for VALORANT~
